# Tourism Agency System

## Project Description:
- This is a project for our Patika+ Bootcamp, in which we have to develop a system for a tourism agency.
- The system must be able to manage the agency's customers, employees, and reservations.
 

## Project Structure:
- There are two main user types, admin and agency employee.
- The admin is responsible for managing the agency's employees; she/he can create new admin and employee profiles.

## Login Panel:
- The user can login to the system with her/his username and password.



## Admin Panel:
- The admin can create new admin and employee profiles.



## Employee Panel:

### Management:

- The employee can create:
    - hotels,

    - rooms for each hotel,

    - and prices for each room with a different accommodation type.


### Sales:

- The employee can create a new reservation for a customer by:
    - searching for an available room using the search panel,

    - selecting the accommodation type and calculating the price,

    - and providing the customer's information.



### Log:
- The employee can see:
            
  - all the reservations created
  - and all current and previous guests.
